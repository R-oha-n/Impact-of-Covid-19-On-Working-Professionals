# Impact-of-Covid-19-On-Working-Professionals
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered work environments worldwide, impacting job security, stress levels, and productivity. This study applies Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to analyze the relationship between various workplace factors—such as stress levels, hours worked per day, and meetings per day—on job security. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover key patterns that influenced professional stability during the pandemic. The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables before model training. The findings of this analysis provide valuable insights into how different professional factors influenced job security during this global crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped traditional work structures, forcing organizations to adapt to remote work, hybrid models, and altered productivity expectations. Professionals across industries faced uncertainty, with job security becoming a crucial concern. Factors such as stress levels, workload, and meeting frequency played a significant role in determining an individual’s employment stability.

This study explores the impact of these variables using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a machine learning technique suitable for predictive modeling in structured datasets. The dataset includes key indicators such as stress levels, daily working hours, and meeting frequency, which are analyzed to understand their correlation with job security.

Through this research, we aim to identify trends that influenced professionals' employment stability, helping organizations and policymakers develop better strategies for workforce management in future crises.
